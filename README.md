# ringtoss

This is a simulator for launching a projectile inside a rotating ring-shaped space habitat. It traces the path of the projectile from a frame of reference that rotates along with the ring, so you can see how the rotation appears to create gravity, even though the projectile travels with constant velocity.

Right now, I think the simulation is incorrect. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
